        <item>Very interesting. As soon as I saw the trailer, I wanted to see it. I work in the professional cv services, and through the big traffic there is no time for going to the cinema, so I will wait for the film to appear in good quality on the Internet. But the trailer is exciting. Everything I love: romance, love and music!</item>
        <item>The story was laughable. The plot holes were immense. The dialogue was atrocious. The special effects were technically competent and pretty but cartoonish and unbelievable. Easily the worst film I have seen in the last year. If it was a bit campy, then it might have succeeded in a kind of sub-Flash-Gordon fashion</item>
        <item>Amazing. Visually stunning. So much going on, but somehow also clear and easy to understand. A little flabby in the middle third, but given the huge cast and story to cover it is very understandable. The highlight was the parings of characters from different stories and their interactions. If you are not a Marvel fan this film will not convert you, but if you have liked any of the previous films you will like this too</item>
        <item>Kind of a The Happening meets A Quiet Place, but better than the latter and way better than the former. Maybe I did not get eeeeeeverything I wanted out of Bird Box but I am still on board. I know that I opened this up by saying the movie is very much like two other movies, but what I liked most about is honestly that it is unlike 99.99% of the horror genre, and that little variation was just what I needed today</item>
        <item>If Bohemian Rhapsody is so great, why was the best part of it Tom Hollander saying a single word? Do not get me wrong, Rami Malek deserves props for the role, that much is true (less perhaps than he is been getting, but still, props). But beyond that, Bohemian Rhapsody is bland, choppy, arguably even offensive. There might be some value in one of those sing-along type deals if you can get enough Queen fans together for one, but I will never know, because I have no interest in re-watching this</item>
        <item>Strong contender for best live-action Transformers movie ever made, but Christ, what a low fucking bar that is. The fact it is not the clear and absolute winner is a devastating criticism</item>
        <item>That is the movie I wanted to see badly for a long time I watched its first part that was too awesome and creed 2 is marvelous I had to do my college homework but I skipped that just to watch creed 2 the training part and the last fight I cannot describe in words what I feels after watched</item>
        <item>The original Mary Poppins was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and it kind of still is. Thus I was indeed a bit worried when I sat down to watch this one with the kids yesterday. After all there is really so many ways a incompetent writer could have screwed this one up. Especially one with an agenda. Luckily this was not the case and I have to say that I quite liked this movie. Disney actually managed to keep the ambiance of the original movie and it actually felt like a Disney movie from the good old days</item>
        <item>I just feel kinda bad for everyone involved. It was clear that whatever was supposed to happen, was tried at. Very hard. But it did not work</item>
        <item>Venom is a great comic adaptation. I really like what they did with the character and the story. I thought the film was done well. The special effects are pretty good. I thought the characters were cast well, and overall I just enjoyed it. The film is pretty dark and violent despite the PG-13 rating. It did not have a lot of blood, but there was a bit here and there. Characters are mostly tossed around and beaten, but a lot of them are not shown dead. That being said, some characters are still killed on screen. People are experimented on. A few people are slashed and stabbed</item>
